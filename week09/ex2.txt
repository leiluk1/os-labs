Let us condider the number of pages: 3

1) The sequence of page references resulted in decreased Hit/Miss Ratio: 1 2 3 4 5 0
Hits: 0
Misses: 6
Ratio: 0.0000

2) The sequence of references resulted in increased Hit/Miss Ratio: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 
Hits: 9 
Misses: 1 
Ratio: 9.0000

The results show that: 
1) If we consider a sequence of references such that all
of the referenced pages are unique, page faults occur on each reference. In such
case, the number of hits is 0 and the ratio is the lowest (that is 0). 

2) To maximize Hit/Miss ratio, we should consider the minimum possible value for
misses that is 1, therefore page fault occurs once when first page comes.
Therefore, when we consider the sequence of references that does not change, we
get the highest ratio.
