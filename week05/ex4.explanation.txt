We got almost similar results as in exercise 3. So, the correlation of the
number of threads to real time, as well as to the user CPU time, remains
the same. 
However, as the number of threads grows, system time (CPU time spent on
system calls inside the kernel) increases. It happens because we use mutexes, which are kernel
objects that require system calls.
