Based on the results, we observe a correlation between the number of threads
and performance growth. Real time decreases significantly as the number of
threads increases. For instance, if we compare the first and the second experiments,
we've halved the time when doubled the number of threads. However, the user CPU time
well almost stays unchanged.
